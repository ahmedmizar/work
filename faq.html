                    Additive manufacturing (AM) provides an efficient high-value
                    manufacturing approach to produce complex net shape (NS)
                    structures, associated with considerable reduction in
                    materials waste compared to other manufacturing processes
                    (e.g. machining). Manufacturing has been identified by the
                    industries in the developed countries as an initiative for
                    growing the manufacturing output. AM is a process of joining
                    materials to produce objects from 3D model data. This is
                    carried out by deposition of layer upon layer, which is
                    opposite to the subtractive manufacturing methodologies such
                    as traditional machining. AM has a number of advantages and
                    benefits which include: (a) 3D CAD drawing of a component to
                    a shape to be converted directly into physical part, (b)
                    Reduction in design constraints, (c) reduction in complex
                    assembly efforts, (d) increases design flexibility, (e)
                    allows near net shapes, and efficient material utilization,
                    (f) lower pollution, and (g) reduced time-to-market needs
                    and hence (h) allows production at a relatively lower cost
                    than traditional manufacturing. AM is classified in terms of
                    the materials feed stock, energy source, build volume,
                    Manufacturing systems are divided into three main categories
                    (although there are many more): (i) powder bed systems, (ii)
                    powder feed (PF) and (iii) wire feed (WF) systems. The
                    energy source are categorized in to electron beam, laser,
                    arc, etc..

                    Wire based additive manufacturing has been introduced as a
                    technology for manufacturing and repair of medium-to-large
                    metallic parts and components with very high precision, high
                    production rate, high mechanical properties and integrity
                    associated with high cost savings compared to conventional
                    techniques such as machining, forging and casting. At AUC,
                    the wire feed additive manufacturing system (November 2016)
                    was acquired and the expertise necessary to operate the
                    system with very high precision has been developed. Using

                    Establishing an Additive Manufacturing facility locally will
                    have a profound <strong>Industrial Impact</strong> in which
                    remanufacturing, repair and maintenance of high-value parts
                    will not be influenced by internal financial factors, or
                    political relations with supplying nations, and will be
                    accomplished over much shorter durations and at a much lower
                    cost. This in turn will positively reflect on the
                    <strong>national economy</strong> through domestic
                    production and repair of parts serving the heavy industry
                    sector and most importantly the biomedical sector. With
                    regards to
                    <strong>employment & social Impact,</strong> historically,
                    revolutionary technological advances have presented
                    opportunities that push the boundaries of societal progress.
                    Additive manufacturing offers a unique proposal; the freedom
                    of design to create more, to inspire innovation, and to
                    better the society. By embracing AM’s full potential and
                    integrating it into traditional manufacturing and product
                    development processes, we will begin to see new applications
                    scaling almost to every industry. Additive manufacturing has
                    given companies a way to limit outsourcing to third parties
                    by developing concepts in house, as well as creating an
                    advantage over competitors by shortening the product
                    development cycle. Last but not least, AM will have a
                    significant <strong>environmental impact</strong> through
                    reduced emissions and waste compared to other manufacturing
                    processes. This in turn has a positive impact on the health
                    and safety of the workers as well as the Egyptian
                    environment at large. AM process also almost eliminates the
                    machining chips resulting from the excessive machining of
                    large blocks into the required parts’ dimensions, except for
                    the minor chipping resulting from the final finishing
                    operations in case of the wire based process. This in turn
                    classifies this process as a green process with minimum
                    scrap or waste. It is also an energyefficient manufacturing
                    approach, compared with energy-intensive manufacturing
                    techniques (e.g. metal casting).

                    components with a single lighter weight ones, which provides
                    higher performance associated with higher durability and
